# Recursion

### This lesson was created by Kaif Jeelani and Keenan Kalra.

## Definition
In simplest terms, recursion is when a function calls upon itself within its body.
Recursive functions are useful as they solve tasks in efficient and elegant ways.

## Real Life Usage
Recursive functions can be used to ensure that the input by the user is correct.
If the user does not input data correctly, the function can be run again until it is correct.

Recursive functions can also be used in place of nested for-loops to track any variable count.
