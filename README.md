# Recursion

### This lesson was created by Kaif Jeelani and Keenan Kalra.

## Definition
In simplest terms, recursion is when a function calls upon itself within its body.
Recursion statements are useful as they solve tasks in efficient and elegant ways.

## Real Life Usage
Recursion functions can be used to ensure that the input by the user is correct.
If the user doesn't follow the necessary guidelines, the function can be run again.
